I am a testing-, operations-, and documentation-obsessed software engineer. I am
primarily looking to join projects involving:

 - programming-language design and implementation,
 - other software-tooling development,
 - technical-debt paydown and maintainability refactors, or
 - accessibility tooling / positive effects on diversity-in-tech

My preferred process involves careful software development using powerful
correctness tools like OCaml and ReasonML; or PLT and JIT/compiler design. I'm
most experienced in: interpreter implementation; open-source library
maintenance; modern JavaScript tooling, versioning, and deployment; JS library
development; server-side development in Node.js or Ruby; POSIX shell and ISO C.


<b><a id="project-experience"></a>PROJECT EXPERIENCE</b>
<b>------------------</b>
Here's a sample of my work, selected primarily for breadth. Where legally
possible, I've included links to source-code that I find to be particularly
exemplary.

<b>### 2018-2019: KidScript, an educational programming-language for kids</b>
<em>    (as Senior Software Engineer at Codeverse)</em>

Codeverse brought me onboard to draw on my open-source experience, improving on
the stability of (and establishing engineering process for) their KidScript
programming-language, as well as an iOS IDE. Responsibilities included:

 - Establish strict Semantic Versioning procedure for the releases of, and
   dependencies between, internal packages and external products
 - Rewrite organization's internal tooling for JavaScript and iOS compilation,
   deployment, etc. effectively from scratch, to enforce good practices
 - Contribute features and handle fixes to the parsing, error-handling, and
   interpreter components of KidScript
 - Manage contributions to the language's standard-library of components and
   objects
 - Review other engineers' contributions to all of the above; providing guidance
   on maintainability and technical debt
 - Rewrite critical portions of the IDE's game/graphics-engine in TypeScript and
   ML to improve stability

<b>### 2010-now: Pratchett, a programming language</b>
My overarching work of the past ten years, Pratchett (née Paws) is the project
that's driven much of my personal development as a programmer. From surveying
prospective users' needs, staying on top of similar language projects and
theoretical research, to organizing a (brief) community of interest and
contributors and triaging design goals to try and keep a sense of constant
progress, this has been my largest ongoing software project.

<b>### 2018-now: Excmd.js, a performant and strict vi-mode parser for Tridactyl</b>
I'm a huge fan of Firefox and Vim; and Tridactyl, a vi-mode for daily web-
browsing. I offered to take over the rewrite of their Exmode (command-line)
parser.

 - <a href="http://ell.io/tt$excmd.js">ell.io/tt$excmd.js</a>

Beyond just improving the parser, my <em>*primary*</em> goal here was to apply
traditional OCaml parsing tooling to a front-end project. I yearn to 'shave the
rough edges' off the user-experience of OCaml for use in the JavaScript
community; and this project gave me a lot of opportunity tES6+ o contribute back. I
spent much time working in the BuckleScript ecosystem and improving the overall
experience of writing ML-for-the-web.

<b>### 2017: Giraphe, a configurable JavaScript graph-walking library</b>
Extracted from my work on Paws.js by necessity, this is an API designed to
generate individual, optimized graph-walking iterators for various Pratchett-
related tasks. (It currently only <em>*implements*</em> a generic, unoptimized walker.)

As of December 2021, I'm busy re-writing this in TypeScript (sadly, not OCaml)
and optimizing for performance.

<b>### Various patches and contributions to others' open-source projects</b>
I'm a repeat open-source developer and patcher. Although so many of my changes
stay local and never see the light of day (a bad habit!), occasionally, I clean
up and complete my explorations, and remember to submit a pull-request.

 - 2020, OCaml/JS: BuckleScript, Bloomberg's OCaml-to-JavaScript compiler

   My most recent sizable contribution, this patch was an on-and-off project
   throughout 2020. I would like to call attention to my documentation, clear
   explanatory git-log, and incremental changes, moreso than the actual
   code-changes I contributed.

<b>### 2016: `pin-cushion`, an API-client for <a href="http://pinboard.in">Pinboard.in</a></b>
A small, one-off, but complete and modern, command-line client for my
bookmarking service of choice. Included simply because it's some of the only
<em>*pure*</em> ES6+ JavaScript I've written this decade, with no legacy cruft.

<b>### 2008: ArchLinux image-builder for Amazon EC2</b>
Arch Linux was unavailable on Amazon EC2 for years. I built an overengineered,
modular shell-script architecture for bundling custom builds of Arch and
publishing them to your EC2 hosts. (This is the largest pure-POSIX-shell program
I've written, and although it showcases well some of my UNIX/sh knowledge, I
wouldn't undertake a project in this way nowadays.)

<b>### 2006-2009: Assorted Ruby tools</b>
I was heavily into metaprogramming Ruby for many years — these are some of the
libraries and tools I was most proud of at the time.
